# Fishing

**Starting Out**

1. **Ensure Registration**: Before fishing, users must start with the bot by using the `/start` command.
2. **Get a Fishing Rod**: Users need a rod to fish. They can buy one from the shop using `/shop rods`. Different rods offer different bonuses.

**The Process of Fishing**

* Users can begin fishing by using the `/fish` command.
* When fishing, users will cast their rod into virtual water, waiting to catch something.
* The bot will respond with an embedded message indicating that the user has cast their line.

**What Can You Catch?**

* **Pokémon**: Various Pokémon can be caught while fishing, with rarity ranging from common to ultra-rare.
* **Items**: Users can also catch items that can be used within the bot's ecosystem. These range from common, cheap items to ultra-rare and valuable ones.
* **Chests**: Occasionally, users might catch chests that contain random rewards.

**Fishing Mechanics**

* **Fishing Rods**: Different rods (e.g., Good Rod, Super Rod) increase the chances of catching better items and Pokémon.
* **Level and EXP**: Users have a fishing level that increases with more fishing. Higher levels unlock better rods and increase the chance of catching rarer items and Pokémon.
* **Energy**: Each fishing attempt consumes energy. Users need to ensure they have enough energy to continue fishing.

**Special Scenarios**

* **Supreme and Master Rods**: These rods require the user to be a certain level to use. They also offer a chance for a re-cast if the user fails to catch something.
* **Guessing Game**: When a Pokémon is hooked, users have 10 seconds to correctly guess its name. If they succeed, they catch the Pokémon; if not, it escapes.
* **Shiny Pokémon**: Rarely, users might encounter a shiny version of a Pokémon.

**Chances and Probabilities**

* **Common to Ultra-Rare**: The bot uses a random number generator to determine what users catch, with certain thresholds for different categories of items and Pokémon.
* **Level Impacts**: A user's fishing level impacts the chances, improving the odds of catching better things as they level up.
* **Rod Impact**: Higher-tier rods increase the chances of catching better items and Pokémon and provide faster fishing times.

**Rewards and Progression**

* **Catching Rewards**: Each successful catch gives the user items, Pokémon, and fishing EXP.
* **Leveling Up**: Gaining enough EXP increases the user's fishing level, which can unlock new rods and improve catch chances.
* **Energy Replenishment**: Users can replenish energy by voting for the bot or waiting for it to refill over time.

**Additional Features**

* **Random Events**: Sometimes, special events like finding a multiplier box or special chests can occur.
* **Achievements**: Users can earn achievements for reaching certain fishing milestones.
* **Leaderboards**: Some bots have leaderboards showcasing the top fishers.

**Tips for Successful Fishing**

1. **Upgrade Rods**: As soon as possible, upgrade your rod to increase your fishing success rate.
2. **Watch Energy Levels**: Keep an eye on your energy to ensure you can keep fishing.
3. **Participate Regularly**: The more you fish, the more chances you have to catch rare items and Pokémon.
4. **Stay Alert**: Be ready to guess the name of the Pokémon to ensure a successful catch.
