\- Ditto can breed with any gender of Pokémon that is not in the undiscovered egg group (legendary, mythical, baby Pokémon, and Ditto). \
\* _Manaphy is an exception which will produce Phione._ -> Female Pokémon and Dittos have a 6 hour cooldown before they can breed again\
`/mothers` - Shows the cooldown timer of all female Pokémon and Ditto -> Eggs created will always hatch into the female Pokémon (or the Pokémon other than Ditto)\
&#x20;

\- There is no penalty for failing to breed, keep going at it!\
\- There is a 35 second cooldown for each breeding attempt\

1\. Place the egg into your party with `/party add slot: (1-6) poke: (Pokémon #)` \
example - `/party add slot: 1 poke: 423`

2.Have the egg selected using `/select poke: (Pokémon #)` \
example - `/select poke: 423`

Eggs hatch based off of the number of messages sent.\
\- Number of messages needed to hatch an egg depends on the Pokémon created and will be shown once an egg is made.

\* Egg only in party = 1 step each message \
\* Egg only selected = 1 step each message\
\* Egg both in party and selected = 2 steps each message

The Bicycle doubles all steps above to hatch your eggs. It is obtainable via the Shop (100 Redeems) or the Worth Too Much Pack (150 Redeems)\

#### Selling Eggs

Eggs you don't wish to hatch are able to be sold for credits `/sell egg num: (Egg #)` - Sells your Egg for credits - Amount of credits gained are based on the IV% of the Egg

#### Breeding for IVs

Without a Destiny Knot, 1 random IV from each parent is passed down to the egg created.

#### Items Used for Breeding

\- _Everstone_: Passes down the Pokémon's nature to the egg

\- _Destiny Knot_: Passes down 2-3 random IVs from the Pokémon to the egg

\- _Ultra Destiny Knot_: Passes down 2-5 random IVs from the Pokémon to the egg

\* Only 1 Destiny Knot will be used if both Pokémon have one.\
Here is the priority of how destiny knots will take account if both parents have one\
1\. Female&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/545329612549521409.png?size=56" alt=":female:"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Destiny Knot&#x20;

\* When using any Destiny Knot, 1 random IV from the other parent will still be passed down, however that IV can be in the same spot where the destiny knot on the other Pokémon chooses to pass down. If that happens then the Destiny Knot IV will take priority over that.
