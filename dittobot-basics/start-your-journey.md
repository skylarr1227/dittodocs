# 1⃣ Start your journey

`/start` - **Now interactive, select your starter Pokémon using the buttons/drop down menus**\
Before you can interact with the bots gameplay, and before you can catch any Pokémon, you must use this command.

2. When you see a Pokémon spawn, catch itd by simply `replying to` or mentioning the bot and saying the Pokémon's name, that's all. You will see a **checkmark** indicating a successful catch if the name was **typed correctly,** and you **pinged/mentioned** the bot at the same time
