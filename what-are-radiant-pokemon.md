# What are Radiant pokemon?

They are a special variant much like Shiny, that are very rare-and beyond that can only be obtained during a very limited window of time-after which they cannot be obtained again in any way.

1. Technically there will be more than 10 pokemon total each month, because each pokemon will be obtained at the lowest possible evolution, and can be evolved into each of its stages just as any other pokemon.
2. The release order will be posted here to show what radiants have been released and when.
3. Breeding radiant pokemon will not ever produce another radiant, however they can be bred as normal.
4. We will hold special giveaways in the Official server where the selected winner will be able to choose a pokemon which has not been released as radiant yet for the following month. These selections will be posted here as well.

## How do users obtain these special pokemon?

Radiant pokemon do not spawn normally at all, nor do they appear from breeding ect. The first way to obtain these variants is through the different quality chests available using the following command to purchase a chest with either credits or redeems:

syntax: `;buy chest [type] [currency type]` example: `;buy chest legend redeems`

The second way is from `Common Chest`'s that can drop from normal pokemon spawns when caught.

#### What is meant by "Limited window of time"?

* Every month, on the **first of the month we will release 10 new Radiant pokemon**.
* **These 10 pokemon will be available to obtain in the methods stated above until the 1st of the following month when the next 10 are released, After the month of their release, they will Never be obtainable again other than from the open market.**
